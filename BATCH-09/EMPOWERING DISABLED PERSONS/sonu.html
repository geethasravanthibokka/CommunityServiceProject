            "Deaf and dumb" (or even just "dumb", when applied to deaf people who do not speak) is an archaic
term that is considered offensive .Many Deaf people do not use spoken language , thus they are
technically "mute". The word "dumb" has atleast an archaic meaning that means "mute". Ofcourse
the word "dumb" also an another more common meaning now that implies stupidiity which certainy
 not applicable to Deaf people being deaf is not a mental illness;its simply problem with 
 hearing, and that affect their ability to speak clearly or in some cases at all.

                Given the long history of deafness, and the fact that Deaf people have been incorrectly assumed to be mentally
                    deficient just because they do not speak, you can be imagine that most Deaf people do not appreciate being the
   appreciate being called "Deaf and Dumb".Today,anyone using  word "dumb" is such context is.. as.. well.. dumb.
    Communication is the   medium by which we can share our thoughts or convey the messages only for deaf persons.
    Because of this, a person who lacks in hearing and speaking ability is not able to stand in race with normal person.
