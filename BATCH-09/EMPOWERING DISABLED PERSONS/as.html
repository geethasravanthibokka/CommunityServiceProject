        Blindness is a <strong>lack of vision.</strong> 
        It may also refer to a loss of vision that cannot be corrected with glasses or contact lenses.
        Partial blindness means you have very limited vision.
        Complete blindness means you cannot see anything and do not see light.

            <h3>Access to information:</h3>
        
            <p1 style="position:relative; top:40px">
                The major sensory organ of a person is their eyes. One glimpse around us is enough to 
                make us realize how visual is most of the information in our environment.Timetables in
                train stations, signs indicating the right way or potential danger, these are all the 
                visual types of information we all come across in our daily life. Most of this information
                is inaccessible for the blind and the visually impaired, inhibiting their independence,
                since access to information signifies autonomy.

            <p1 style="position:relative; top:40px">
                It's very common for sighted individuals, strangers, friends or family, to be overly 
                                            excited to help a visually impaired person. Blind people might perform a regular task
                                            slower but that doesn't mean they're incapable of completing it. Rushing to help the 
                                            visually impaired without asking or being asked to do so, might make them feel helpless 
                                            instead of independent.

            <h3>CVI</h3>
        
            <p1 style="position:relative; top:40px">
                CVI, or cortical/cerebral visual impairment, is the leading cause of modern day blindness in children. Unlike ocular forms of visual impairment, CVI is a brain-based disorder,
                 and often coexists with an additional visual impairment. A child with CVI, for example, may see the world as a swirling mass of color.</p>
                 <p style="font-size:32px; position:relative; top:100px;color:black">
<strong>Treatement: </strong> There's no cure for CVI, but vision rehabilitation 
can help people with CVI make the most of their vision.
 For some people with CVI,
  vision problems get better over time on their own.

                Retinitis pigmentosa is a genetic disorder, which affects up

                 People with this eye condition often have trouble seeing

            <p1 style="position:relative; top:40px">
                Macular degeneration is another one of the leading causes of vision loss, affecting an estimated 10 million people in the U.S. 
There are a few types of this condition, but the most common is called dry macular degeneration. This type of visual impairment is found in adults, and causes a personâ€™s central vision to deteriorate.

            <p style="font-size:32px; position:relative; top:100px;color:black">
                <strong>Treatement: </strong>         There's currently no treatment for early AMD, so your eye doctor will probably just keep track of how your eyes are doing with regular eye exams. Eating healthy, getting regular exercise, and quitting smoking can also help.

                <strong>Braille</strong> is a tactile writing system 
                used by people who are visually impaired, 
                including people who are blind, 
                deafblind or who have low vision. 
                It can be read either on embossed paper or 
                by using refreshable braille displays that connect to
                 computers and smartphone devices.
