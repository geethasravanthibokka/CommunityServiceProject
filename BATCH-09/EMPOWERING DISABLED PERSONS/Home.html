     <p1>History has seen the absolute most exceptional accomplishments by men and women in due course of time.  <br>

      However, the accomplishment is considerably more valued if it has been tended with an evident physical disability. <br>
      
      For an ordinary man, to achieve success is most challenging and should have a lot of courage when he lacks something. 
      <br>
      
      It just requires confidence, energy, and passion for a person with the disability to level the popularity.</p1>

  <h3>HERE, We go in detail </h3>
  <div class="d9">
    <h2 class="q1" >BLIND</h2>
    <p>One key message relayed is making sure we treat every blind person as worthwhile, 
      no matter what their blindness skill set. In the blindness community,
      some who have been blind for a long time may expect newly blind people just to "get over it," meaning the urge to stay home and to depend on others to assist them. We need to reassure them that it is OK for them to try new things and not expect to learn everything immediately.

    <h2 class="q1" >Disability of person with no arms and legs</h2>
     <p>There are many common problems faced by those with a physical disability. These challenges can include everything from maneuvering around a home with limited mobility to finding accessible transportation. Fortunately, there are many solutions available that can help to make life easier.
      The economic empowerment of persons with disabilities can be achieved if they have access to jobs and livelihoods and basic entitlements, such as education, health services, and housing.<a href="g.html" class="c1">CLICK HERE</a>... for more details</p>

    <h2 class="q1" >Deaf and Dumb</h2>
    <p>It is important that people feel able to express themselves and attain fluent, two way communication amongst the hearing as well as the non-hearing.Our customs and traditions have been passed down to us with our values and beliefs about the “Deaf and Dumb” to constitute our culture of the hearing impaired.
