                    A physical disability can be caused by different factors.
                    It may due to natural aging, a chronic illness, or an unfortunate accident.
                    <strong>Phocomelia </strong>is a condition that involves malformations of 
                    human arms and legs. Whichever the case may be, the result is a weakened functioning ability.
                    This affects one’s ability to accomplish day-to-day activities.And more often than not,
                    it results in less independence.

                    A person with a disability means a person with long termphysical,mental, intellectual or 
                    sensory impairment which, in interaction with barriers,hinders his full and effective 
                    participation in society equally with others.  The estimated one billion people living 
                    with disabilities worldwide face many barriers to inclusion in some key aspects of society.
                    As a result, they do not enjoy access on an equal basis as others which includes
                    areas such as transportation and employment but also social participation like politics
                    or entertainment.

                    The role of a community towards the disabled individual can be easily elaborated 
                    if we emphasize on creating friendly relationships with pure intent and understanding. 
                    First of all —
                    the importance of forming a bond has hence permitted the individuals to collaborate 
                    and empathize with the disabled individuals which thus automatically creates 
                    a sense of worth and belonging.In contrast, a distressed disabled individual won’t be able 
                    to be productive if he/she is left alone so therefore, building a connectivity bridge will 
                    lead to finding out the similarities and the differences of each and every individual
                    within the community.
